This is a simple paint application created purely with HTML5/JavaScript (with a dash
of jQuery thrown in for good measure). 

The name says it all - just paint. Simply fire up index.html in your browser and start drawing.
Just click to select any color on the color palette. To fill the screen with a certain 
color, click the color, and then click the bucket. To clear the screen, click on white,
and then click the bucket. Finally, to save your work of art, simply click the save button.

The purpose of this application was not to perform any software engineering wizardry, but 
rather, show how far HTML has come, and to demonstrate how much can be done with just
a few lines of code. Sometimes, simplicity is beautiful.
